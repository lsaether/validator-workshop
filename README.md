# validator-workshop

Welcome to the accompanying assets to the Validator Workshop. In this repository you'll find written instructions and the necessary `chainspec.json` for connecting to the test network and run a validator.

## About the testnet

This is a public testnet set up by Web3 Foundation for the purpose of allowing people to try being validators. It is more up-to-date with the latest code than the Alexander testnet and will be nearly identical to the experience of validating on a live chain. We will not keep this testnet running forever so don't be surprised when it eventually gets turned off.
